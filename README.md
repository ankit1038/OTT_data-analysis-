# OTT_data-analysis-
Problem Statement:

As the demand for streaming content continues to grow, understanding patterns in content type, release trends, and viewer-relevant attributes has become crucial for OTT platforms. This project aims to perform a comprehensive data analysis of a OTT platform to uncover insights related to content distribution, popularity, and regional presence.

The analysis focuses on answering key questions such as:

-Analyzing the proportion of Movies versus TV Shows along with common rating trends.
-Exploring yearly content release patterns and identifying top countries contributing the most content.
-Highlighting prominent directors, actors, and key contributors, especially in Indian productions.
-Categorizing content by genre and descriptive keywords to assess tone and apply content labels.
-Uncovering unique segments such as multi-season TV shows, entries with missing data, and recent additions.
-The goal is to leverage SQL for data extraction and analysis to support OTT platforms in refining content strategies, enhancing recommendations, and boosting user engagement.
